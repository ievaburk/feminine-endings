From the besieged Ardea all in post, 
Borne by the trustless wings of false desire, 
Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host, 
And to Collatium bears the lightless fire, 
Which in pale embers hid, lurks to aspire, 
 And girdle with embracing flames the waist 
 Of Collatine's fair love, Lucrece the chaste. 
 
Happ'ly that name of "chaste" unhapp'ly set 
This bateless edge on his keen appetite; 
When Collatine unwisely did not let 
To praise the clear unmatched red and white 
Which triumphed in that sky of his delight; 
 Where mortal stars as bright as heaven's beauties, 
 With pure aspects did him peculiar duties. 
 
For he the night before, in Tarquin's tent, 
Unlocked the treasure of his happy state; 
What priceless wealth the heavens had him lent 
In the possession of his beauteous mate; 
Reck'ning his fortune at such high proud rate 
 That kings might be espoused to more fame, 
 But king nor peer to such a peerless dame. 
 
O happiness enjoyed but of a few, 
And if possessed, as soon decayed and done 
As is the morning's silver melting dew 
Against the golden splendor of the sun! 
An expired date, cancelled ere well begun. 
 Honor and beauty, in the owner's arms, 
 Are weakly fortressed from a world of harms. 
 
Beauty itself doth of itself persuade 
The eyes of men without an orator; 
What needeth then apology be made 
To set forth that which is so singular? 
Or why is Collatine the publisher 
 Of that rich jewel he should keep unknown 
 From thievish ears because it is his own? 
 
Perchance his boast of Lucrece' sov'reignty 
Suggested this proud issue of a king; 
For by our ears our hearts oft tainted be; 
Perchance that envy of so rich a thing, 
Braving compare, disdainfully did sting 
His high-pitched thoughts, that meaner men should vaunt 
 That golden hap which their superiors want. 
 
But some untimely thought did instigate 
His all too timeless speed, if none of those. 
His honor, his affairs, his friends, his state, 
Neglected all, with swift intent he goes 
To quench the coal which in his liver glows. 
 O rash false heat, wrapped in repentant cold, 
 Thy hasty spring still blasts and ne'er grows old! 
 
When at Collatium this false lord arrived, 
Well was he welcomed by the Roman dame, 
Within whose face beauty and virtue strived 
Which of them both should underprop her fame. 
When virtue bragged, beauty would blush for shame; 
 When beauty boasted blushes, in despite 
 Virtue would stain that o'er with silver white. 
 
But beauty, in that white entitled 
From Venus' doves, doth challenge that fair field; 
Then virtue claims from beauty beauty's red, 
Which virtue gave the golden age to gild 
Their silver cheeks, and called it then their shield, 
 Teaching them thus to use it in the fight, 
 When shame assailed, the red should fence the white. 
 
This heraldry in Lucrece' face was seen, 
Argued by beauty's red and virtue's white; 
Of either's color was the other queen, 
Proving from world's minority their right; 
Yet their ambition makes them still to fight, 
 The sovereignty of either being so great 
 That oft they interchange each other's seat. 
 
This silent war of lilies and of roses, 
Which Tarquin viewed in her fair face's field, 
In their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses, 
Where lest between them both it should be killed, 
The coward captive vanquished doth yield 
 To those two armies that would let him go, 
 Rather than triumph in so false a foe. 
 
Now thinks he that her husband's shallow tongue, 
The niggard prodigal that praised her so, 
In that high task hath done her beauty wrong, 
Which far exceeds his barren skill to show. 
Therefore that praise which Collatine doth owe, 
 Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise, 
 In silent wonder of still-gazing eyes. 
 
This earthly saint, adored by this devil, 
Little suspecteth the false worshipper: 
For unstained thoughts do seldom dream on evil; 
Birds never limed no secret bushes fear. 
So guiltless she securely gives good cheer 
 And reverend welcome to her princely guest, 
 Whose inward ill no outward harm expressed. 
 
For that he colored with his high estate, 
Hiding base sin in pleats of majesty; 
That nothing in him seemed inordinate, 
Save sometime too much wonder of his eye, 
Which having all, all could not satisfy; 
 But poorly rich, so wanteth in his store, 
 That cloyed with much, he pineth still for more. 
 
But she that never coped with stranger eyes, 
Could pick no meaning from their parling looks, 
Nor read the subtle shining secrecies 
Writ in the glassy margents of such books. 
She touched no unknown baits, nor feared no hooks, 
 Nor could she moralize his wanton sight, 
 More than his eyes were opened to the light. 
 
He stories to her ears her husband's fame, 
Won in the fields of fruitful Italy; 
And decks with praises Collatine's high name, 
Made glorious by his manly chivalry, 
With bruised arms and wreaths of victory. 
 Her joy with heaved-up hand she doth express, 
 And wordless so greets heaven for his success. 
 
Far from the purpose of his coming thither, 
He makes excuses for his being there. 
No cloudy show of stormy blust'ring weather 
Doth yet in his fair welkin once appear, 
Till sable Night, mother of dread and fear, 
 Upon the world dim darkness doth display, 
 And in her vaulty prison stows the day. 
 
For then is Tarquin brought unto his bed, 
Intending weariness with heavy sprite; 
For after supper long he questioned 
With modest Lucrece, and wore out the night. 
Now leaden slumber with live's strength doth fight, 
 And every one to rest himself betakes, 
 Save thieves, and cares, and troubled minds that wakes. 
 
As one of which doth Tarquin lie revolving 
The sundry dangers of his will's obtaining; 
Yet ever to obtain his will resolving, 
Though weak-built hopes persuade him to abstaining: 
Despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining, 
 And when great treasure is the meed proposed, 
 Though death be adjunct, there's no death supposed. 
 
Those that much covet are with gain so fond, 
That what they have not, that which they possess, 
They scatter and unloose it from their bond, 
And so by hoping more they have but less, 
Or gaining more, the profit of excess 
 Is but to surfeit, and such griefs sustain 
 That they prove bankrout in this poor rich gain. 
 
The aim of all is but to nurse the life 
With honor, wealth, and ease, in waning age; 
And in this aim there is such thwarting strife 
That one for all, or all for one, we gage: 
As life for honor in fell battle's rage, 
 Honor for wealth, and oft that wealth doth cost 
 The death of all, and all together lost. 
 
So that in vent'ring ill we leave to be 
The things we are, for that which we expect; 
And this ambitious foul infirmity, 
In having much, torments us with defect 
Of that we have: so then we do neglect 
 The thing we have, and all for want of wit, 
 Make something nothing by augmenting it. 
 
Such hazard now must doting Tarquin make, 
Pawning his honor to obtain his lust, 
And for himself himself he must forsake. 
Then where is truth, if there be no self-trust? 
When shall he think to find a stranger just, 
 When he himself himself confounds, betrays 
 To sland'rous tongues and wretched hateful days? 
 
Now stole upon the time the dead of night, 
When heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes; 
No comfortable star did lend his light, 
No noise but owls' and wolves' death-boding cries; 
Now serves the season that they may surprise 
 The silly lambs: pure thoughts are dead and still, 
 While lust and murder wakes to stain and kill. 
 
And now this lustful lord leapt from his bed, 
Throwing his mantle rudely o'er his arm, 
Is madly tossed between desire and dread; 
Th' one sweetly flatters, th' other feareth harm, 
But honest fear, bewitched with lust's foul charm, 
 Doth too too oft betake him to retire, 
 Beaten away by brain-sick rude desire. 
 
His falchion on a flint he softly smiteth, 
That from the cold stone sparks of fire do fly, 
Whereat a waxen torch forthwith he lighteth, 
Which must be lodestar to his lustful eye; 
And to the flame thus speaks advisedly: 
 "As from this cold flint I enforced this fire, 
 So Lucrece must I force to my desire." 
 
Here pale with fear he doth premeditate 
The dangers of his loathsome enterprise; 
And in his inward mind he doth debate 
What following sorrow may on this arise. 
Then looking scornfully, he doth despise 
 His naked armor of still-slaughtered lust, 
 And justly thus controls his thoughts unjust: 
 
"Fair torch, burn out thy light, and lend it not 
To darken her whose light excelleth thine; 
And die, unhallowed thoughts, before you blot 
With your uncleanness that which is divine; 
Offer pure incense to so pure a shrine: 
 Let fair humanity abhor the deed 
 That spots and stains love's modest snow-white weed. 
 
"O shame to knighthood, and to shining arms! 
O foul dishonor to my household's grave! 
O impious act including all foul harms! 
A martial man to be soft fancy's slave! 
True valor still a true respect should have; 
 Then my digression is so vile, so base, 
 That it will live engraven in my face. 
 
"Yea, though I die, the scandal will survive, 
And be an eye-sore in my golden coat; 
Some loathsome dash the herald will contrive, 
To cipher me how fondly I did dote; 
That my posterity, shamed with the note, 
 Shall curse my bones, and hold it for no sin 
 To wish that I their father had not been. 
 
"What win I if I gain the thing I seek? 
A dream, a breath, a froth of fleeting joy. 
Who buys a minute's mirth to wail a week? 
Or sells eternity to get a toy? 
For one sweet grape who will the vine destroy? 
 Or what fond beggar, but to touch the crown, 
 Would with the sceptre straight be strooken down? 
 
"If Collatinus dream of my intent, 
Will he not wake, and in a desp'rate rage 
Post hither, this vile purpose to prevent? 
This siege that hath engirt his marriage, 
This blur to youth, this sorrow to the sage, 
 This dying virtue, this surviving shame, 
 Whose crime will bear an ever-during blame. 
 
"O, what excuse can my invention make 
When thou shalt charge me with so black a deed? 
Will not my tongue be mute, my frail joints shake? 
Mine eyes forgo their light, my false heart bleed? 
The guilt being great, the fear doth still exceed; 
 And extreme fear can neither fight nor fly, 
 But coward-like with trembling terror die. 
 
"Had Collatinus killed my son or sire, 
Or lain in ambush to betray my life, 
Or were he not my dear friend, this desire 
Might have excuse to work upon his wife, 
As in revenge or quittal of such strife; 
 But as he is my kinsman, my dear friend, 
 The shame and fault finds no excuse nor end. 
 
"Shameful it is: ay, if the fact be known; 
Hateful it is: there is no hate in loving; 
I'll beg her love: but she is not her own; 
The worst is but denial and reproving. 
My will is strong, past reason's weak removing: 
 Who fears a sentence or an old man's saw 
 Shall by a painted cloth be kept in awe. 
 
Thus graceless holds he disputation 
'Tween frozen conscience and hot burning will, 
And with good thoughts makes dispensation, 
Urging the worser sense for vantage still; 
Which in a moment doth confound and kill 
 All pure effects, and doth so far proceed 
 That what is vile shows like a virtuous deed. 
 
Quoth he, "She took me kindly by the hand, 
And gazed for tidings in my eager eyes, 
Fearing some hard news from the warlike band 
Where her beloved Collatinus lies. 
O how her fear did make her color rise! 
 First red as roses that on lawn we lay, 
 Then white as lawn, the roses took away. 
 
"And how her hand, in my hand being locked, 
Forced it to tremble with her loyal fear! 
Which strook her sad, and then it faster rocked, 
Until her husband's welfare she did hear; 
Whereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer 
 That had Narcissus seen her as she stood, 
 Self-love had never drowned him in the flood. 
 
"Why hunt I then for color or excuses? 
All orators are dumb when beauty pleadeth, 
Poor wretches have remorse in poor abuses, 
Love thrives not in the heart that shadows dreadeth, 
Affection is my captain, and he leadeth; 
 And when his gaudy banner is displayed, 
 The coward fights, and will not be dismayed. 
 
"Then childish fear avaunt, debating die! 
Respect and reason wait on wrinkled age! 
My heart shall never countermand mine eye. 
Sad pause and deep regard beseems the sage; 
My part is youth, and beats these from the stage. 
 Desire my pilot is, beauty my prize, 
 Then who fears sinking where such treasure lies?" 
 
As corn o'ergrown by weeds, so heedful fear 
Is almost choked by unresisted lust. 
Away he steals with open list'ning ear, 
Full of foul hope, and full of fond mistrust; 
Both which, as servitors to the unjust, 
 So cross him with their opposite persuasion, 
 That now he vows a league, and now invasion. 
 
Within his thought her heavenly image sits, 
And in the self-same seat sits Collatine. 
That eye which looks on her confounds his wits; 
That eye which him beholds, as more divine, 
Unto a view so false will not incline, 
 But with a pure appeal seeks to the heart, 
 Which once corrupted takes the worser part; 
 
And therein heartens up his servile powers, 
Who flatt'red by their leader's jocund show, 
Stuff up his lust, as minutes fill up hours; 
And as their captain, so their pride doth grow, 
Paying more slavish tribute than they owe. 
 By reprobate desire thus madly led, 
 The Roman lord marcheth to Lucrece' bed. 
 
The locks between her chamber and his will, 
Each one by him enforced retires his ward; 
But as they open they all rate his ill, 
Which drives the creeping thief to some regard. 
The threshold grates the door to have him heard; 
 Night-wand'ring weasels shriek to see him there; 
 They fright him, yet he still pursues his fear. 
 
As each unwilling portal yields him way, 
Through little vents and crannies of the place 
The wind wars with his torch to make him stay, 
And blows the smoke of it into his face, 
Extinguishing his conduct in this case; 
 But his hot heart, which fond desire doth scorch, 
 Puffs forth another wind that fires the torch. 
 
And being lighted, by the light he spies 
Lucretia's glove, wherein her needle sticks. 
He takes it from the rushes where it lies, 
And griping it, the needle his finger pricks, 
As who should say, "This glove to wanton tricks 
 Is not inured; return again in haste, 
 Thou seest our mistress' ornaments are chaste." 
 
But all these poor forbiddings could not stay him, 
He in the worst sense consters their denial: 
The doors, the wind, the glove that did delay him, 
He takes for accidental things of trial; 
Or as those bars which stop the hourly dial, 
 Who with a ling'ring stay his course doth let, 
 Till every minute pays the hour his debt. 
 
"So, so," quoth he, "these lets attend the time, 
Like little frosts that sometime threat the spring, 
To add a more rejoicing to the prime, 
And give the sneaped birds more cause to sing. 
Pain pays the income of each precious thing: 
 Huge rocks, high winds, strong pirates, shelves and sands 
 The merchant fears, ere rich at home he lands." 
 
Now is he come unto the chamber door 
That shuts him from the heaven of his thought, 
Which with a yielding latch, and with no more, 
Hath barred him from the blessed thing he sought. 
So from himself impiety hath wrought, 
 That for his prey to pray he doth begin, 
 As if the heavens should countenance his sin. 
 
But in the midst of his unfruitful prayer, 
Having solicited th' eternal power 
That his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair, 
And they would stand auspicious to the hour, 
Even there he starts: quoth he, "I must deflow'r; 
 The powers to whom I pray abhor this fact, 
 How can they then assist me in the act? 
 
"Then Love and Fortune be my gods, my guide! 
My will is backed with resolution. 
Thoughts are but dreams till their effects be tried, 
The blackest sin is cleared with absolution; 
Against love's fire fear's frost hath dissolution. 
 The eye of heaven is out, and misty night 
 Covers the shame that follows sweet delight." 
 
This said, his guilty hand plucked up the latch, 
And with his knee the door he opens wide. 
The dove sleeps fast that this night-owl will catch; 
Thus treason works ere traitors be espied. 
Who sees the lurking serpent steps aside; 
 But she sound sleeping, fearing no such thing, 
 Lies at the mercy of his mortal sting. 
 
Into the chamber wickedly he stalks, 
And gazeth on her yet unstained bed. 
The curtains being close, about he walks, 
Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head. 
By their high treason is his heart misled, 
 Which gives the watch-word to his hand full soon 
 To draw the cloud that hides the silver moon. 
 
Look as the fair and fiery-pointed sun, 
Rushing from forth a cloud, bereaves our sight, 
Even so the curtain drawn, his eyes begun 
To wink, being blinded with a greater light: 
Whether it is that she reflects so bright 
 That dazzleth them, or else some shame supposed, 
 But blind they are, and keep themselves enclosed. 
 
O had they in that darksome prison died, 
Then had they seen the period of their ill! 
Then Collatine again by Lucrece' side 
In his clear bed might have reposed still. 
But they must ope, this blessed league to kill, 
 And holy-thoughted Lucrece to their sight 
 Must sell her joy, her life, her world's delight.
